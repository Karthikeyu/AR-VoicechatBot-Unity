# AR-voice-chatBot-PandaBot-using-unity

Hi. This a project for a humanoid voice chat bot andiod application that can interact with people using voice commands with limited intelligence. A life sized panda that can listen your queries and talk to you in real life also using augmented reality. The chatbot is developed using AIML (Artificial MarkUp Language) which is XML based markup language that can be used to develop artificial intelligence applications. It is integrated with unity in this project. The AIML integration to unity was alredy developed [by Jeffereson](https://github.com/JeffersonReisPro/aimlbot-for-unity3d). For the voice integration, a native andriod plugin has been developed for speech to text to use in unity. For text to speech, an exernal API has been used named [VoiceRRS](http://www.voicerss.org/api/documentation.aspx). Finally, for AR part, arcore sdk has been used from google for plane detection.
